# StockPredictor

How to build 3 different types of regression lines to predict stock prices using Python, then print out the prediction for the best performing one.

Step 1 - Go to Yahoo Finance and find a stock price that you want to predict. Click on historical data, then download the CSV of that stocks price history (I used GE) https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GE/ 

Step 2 - Use Scikit learn to try out 3 different types of regression models to predict the price of that stock for a future date. See this https://towardsdatascience.com/in-12-minutes-stocks-analysis-with-pandas-and-scikit-learn-a8d8a7b50ee7  as an example and the scikit learn docs to see all the different types of regression models you can easily build (i.e quadratic, linear, lasso, ridge, etc.)

Step 3 - Visualize your result using matplotlib or another plotting library of your choice

Results will allow you to predict the stock price.
